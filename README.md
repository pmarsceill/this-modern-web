# This Modern Web

_The personal website of Patrick Marsceill_

---

Made with [GatsbyJS](https://gatsbyjs.org), so [all the standard Gatsby CLI stuff applies](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli).

#### Set up

`yarn install` to get all the dependencies

#### Building and running

- `gatsby develop` for a local dev server
- `gatsby build` for a complete rebuild
- `gatsby serve` for a production server
- `npm run format` runs Prettier

---

#### Special stuff:

- This site references my Micropub endpoint for easily posting Microblog entries from various clients and syndicating them to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/pmarsceill) via RSS
- This site has two RSS feeds, [one specifically for Micro.blog](/microblog.xmlhttps://www.thismodernweb.com/microblog.xml) and the other for [general public consumption](https://www.thismodernweb.com/rss.xml)
