Most Thursday nights, I was with three other humans in a too hot (or too cold) room constructed out of hastily framed walls, unfinished drywall, and 200 year old brick. Ah band practice, how I miss you. These days you'll find me at "band practice" in my home office smashing buttons on my Ableton Push, trying to get the most out of samples, VST instruments, and a lot of trial and error. A different kind of fun.
