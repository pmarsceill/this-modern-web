I love me some internet nostalgia and [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) does not disappoint.

> 98.css is a CSS library for building interfaces that look like Windows 98.

A pretty damn faithful recreation of the UI that sent me online curiously building my first web pages, Winamp skins, Visual Basic programs, and pirated copies of PhotoShop.
