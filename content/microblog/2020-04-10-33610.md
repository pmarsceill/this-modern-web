Some thoughts I had this week:

- I’ve never been this conscious about what I'm eating every day because we only have a finite supply of staples like eggs, butter, milk, bread, etc…
- I've never been this conscious of how I manage my time every day because my wife and I are splitting childcare duties and we need to balance getting work done and not sitting my daughter in front of a screen all day
- I've never been this conscious of how often I work out because we all need to get some physical exercise to stay mentally and physically well

Wellness in the time of global un-wellness, I guess.
