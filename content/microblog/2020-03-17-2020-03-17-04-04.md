Got inspired by [Rafa’s Shortcut](https://twitter.com/rafahari/status/1239682156919762946?s=21) and whipped [my own Apple Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/98ce69a7f59640ce931e45f3d69d2adf) up to automate posting media and books to my [Inbox](https://thismodernweb.com/inbox) from my iPhone. All I need is to select cover art from my Photos and the shortcut handles everything else (except the merge into `master`).
