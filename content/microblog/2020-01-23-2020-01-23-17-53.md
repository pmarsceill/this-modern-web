Google is in a prime position to "pants" Apple over this encrypted [iPhone back-up mess](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-fbi-icloud-exclusive-idUSKBN1ZK1CT). Apple's [recent marketing campaign as being the company that cares about privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py0acqg1oKc) is essentially meaningless if the reports are true that Apple shut down plans for encrypted iPhone backups to iCloud after the FBI complained, while [Google has had this feature in place for years](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/google-and-android-have-your-back-by.html).
