I am very excited to hear that [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) (my RSS reader of choice) is going to get iCloud syncing support! That was literally the only wishlist feature that I had for this app. Maurice Parker, a developer on the project [wrote a nice piece about building the feature](https://vincode.io/2020/04/09/cloudkit-impressions-from.html) and his impressions of CloudKit in general.
