Since 2015, Bloomberg Businessweek staff has published a [Jealousy List](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-jealousy-list/) of work that they recognize as top-notch.

> At Bloomberg Businessweek, we read—a lot. We also listen to podcasts and watch a ton of stuff (often with borrowed passwords). Sometimes we read, watch, or listen to something that we wish we had published. To recognize a job well done, the magazine’s staff and many of our contributors in the Bloomberg newsroom have compiled our annual yearend Jealousy List. Congratulations to those on this year’s list, we hate/love you. —The Editors

In the spirit of sharing great work, I wanted to create a similar list focusing on some of the great work that I've come across this past year (and I wish had my fingerprints on it).
