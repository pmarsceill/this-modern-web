Since 2015, Bloomberg Businessweek staff has published a [Jealousy List](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-jealousy-list/) of work that they recognize as top-notch.

> At Bloomberg Businessweek, we read—a lot. We also listen to podcasts and watch a ton of stuff (often with borrowed passwords). Sometimes we read, watch, or listen to something that we wish we had published. To recognize a job well done, the magazine’s staff and many of our contributors in the Bloomberg newsroom have compiled our annual yearend Jealousy List. Congratulations to those on this year’s list, we hate/love you. —The Editors

In the spirit of sharing great work, I wanted to create a similar list focusing on some of the great work that I've come across this past year (and I wish had my fingerprints on it).

- [Cron](https://cron.io) - I don't _love_ using Google Calendar, but I do love using Cron. Cron is a native app that allows gives you an iterface to Google Calendar and has a very robust keyboard-first approach.

- [briOS](https://brianlovin.com) - Brian Lovin's site redesign featuring an app-like interface, internal commenting system, stack-tracking system, and more features that stretch the boundaries personal site and personal app. [GitHub](https://github.com/brianlovin/brios)

- [Automator](https://automator.design) - As if everything that Jordan Singer makes doesn't make me jealous, this Figma automation suite is certainly one of the most worthy of this list.

- [Radix](https://radix-ui.com) - Radix is a set of unstyled, accessible, and high composable components for React ready for your next project. [GitHub](https://github.com/modulz/radix-ui)

- [Companion in a box](https://www.companioninabox.art) - The only NFTs set that I'm legitimatlly jealous of. Fellow GitHubber [@mkwng](https://twitter.com/mkwng) created a beautiful system of companions that hang out into said box.

- [Minimal Shapes](https://adrianmg.gumroad.com/) - Adrian and I worked together for a while at GitHub and I remember when he started playing around with Blender a few years ago... Now he's got the most beautiful collection of wallpapers and textures.

- [leerob.io](https://leerob.io) - Ever wonder what the "right way" to make a Next.js personal site/blog/portfolio is? I've found my self splunking Lee's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) for tips and tricks more than once.
