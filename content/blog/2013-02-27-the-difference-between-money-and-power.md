    <p>Such a waste of talent. He chose money over power, in this town a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years, power is the old stone building that stands for centuries.

The first season of _[House of Cards](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/House_of_Cards/70178217?locale=en-US)_ has ended for me.  I tore through the thirteen episode season in about a week after having recently cancelled my cable. I miss watching _House of Cards_, I do not miss having cable television.
