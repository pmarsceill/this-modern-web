In the beginning of January, I left my job at [GitHub](https://github.com) after six and-a-half years. It was a hard choice mostly because I wasn't unhappy there, I had just [done the best work of my career](https://github.com/features/issues), I had built a network of people that I trusted, and I had an incredible sense of job security. _So why did I leave?_

A few months before I decided that It Was Time™, I had a discussion with someone that I trust implicitly with my career. During our talk, it was pointed out to me that unknowingly I was exhibiting signs of someone who was looking for a my next thing. The GitHub that I joined in 2015 was a very different place than it is today. You could change just about anything with a pull request (and were encouraged to), even though management had just been implemented, much of an employee's expectations were still tied to shipping / output. This meant that as a product designer you got to wear a lot of hats, processes were loose and experimental — if there at all, and you really got a sense that everyone at the company was all pushing toward something together.

As GitHub grew and scaled, more formal processes were built around the work we did, things became more complicated as more specialized roles were added, and the path to shipping the product grew longer and less straightforward. The entrepreneurial instincts that I had in my first few years were slowly exchanged for figuring out how to fit in bits that _I_ cared about into the larger product.

The reality of working for a big tech company in 2022 is that you get consistency, job security, above-market salary and equity, and if you're there long enough you get to specialize in things. The tradeoffs become your own personal impact (on a company level), the ability to take big risks, and straying outside of established processes without asking for permission/forgiveness. Publicly traded tech stocks are at all-time highs so if you are getting compensated with equity, your potential upside is limited. Some people are completely content (and even thrive) with all of this sense of stability and predictability, and to them I say, "Cheers." For me though, I began to feel the friction and was starting to show signs of burnout.

## What I was looking for

At a certain point after this conversation, I realized that I never wrote down the things that I wanted from a potential employer before. I had a lot of ideas about the type of role that I wanted, but not the type of place I wanted to work. Back in 2020, after a few years I realized that a management wasn't for me so I dove head-on into a staff designer role. There's [been a lot written about the pursuing a senior+ IC designer track](https://staff.design), but I don't think I've really thought about

1. I love making tools for people who make.

1. Getting in early was important to me.

1. I would trade salary for equity. If sign and offer someplace, it means I believe in what their building and I want in.

1. As few levels of management as possible.

1. A familiar set of tools / tech stack.

1. Funded or a clear path to it.
