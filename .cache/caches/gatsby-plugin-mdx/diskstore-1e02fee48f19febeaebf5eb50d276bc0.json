I kept refining it in Photoshop over and over until it started to resemble something like fragments of different pages. I sent early versions of the design to other designers and asked for feedback. Finally—and perhaps most importantly—I took time away from the design and came back to it with fresh eyes every few days.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`I set a code deadline.`}</strong>{` The design certainly wasn’t perfect in the PSD by the time I started coding it, but it didn’t need to be. By getting it into the browser by a certain date, I could make better design decisions and execute them faster. The final grid and type scale were developed entirely in code using general ideas of columns/gutter proportions and loose type sizes from the PSD. At the same time, I had little patterns established from the design comp that I iterated on and re-used throughout the site as a coded it.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\"><strong parentName=\"p\">{`I didn’t set a launch date.`}</strong>{` This really wasn’t a purposeful decision. Just a feeling that if I could live with the design locally and chisel away at it until it felt right, it would evolve in the most organic way possible. I looked at the fully coded site every day for about a month (in my local dev environment), even if just for five minutes at a time. While I was browsing other sites, I would purposefully pull it up to see what the experience was like—judging how natural or jarring it felt. This lead me to discover more details that I wanted to temper and I hammered at them until they felt `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`done`}</em>{`.`}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <figure {...{\n      \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figure\",\n      \"style\": {}\n    }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"721px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/dcd220ace5fe2f016b32c9d56be6f224/2fa75/ps-diary.jpg\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"75.99999999999999%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"An excerpt of my Photoshop Diary\",\n            \"title\": \"An excerpt of my Photoshop Diary\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/dcd220ace5fe2f016b32c9d56be6f224/2fa75/ps-diary.jpg\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/dcd220ace5fe2f016b32c9d56be6f224/f93b5/ps-diary.jpg 300w\", \"/static/dcd220ace5fe2f016b32c9d56be6f224/b4294/ps-diary.jpg 600w\", \"/static/dcd220ace5fe2f016b32c9d56be6f224/2fa75/ps-diary.jpg 721w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span>{`\n    `}<figcaption parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"\n      }}>{`An excerpt of my Photoshop Diary`}</figcaption>{`\n  `}</figure>\n    <p>{`Out of this thing comes a desire to try to break some of the rigidity that I impose on myself for both personal and professional projects.
