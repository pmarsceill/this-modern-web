Sure, I’ve designed a lot of sites and apps for a variety of clients—but I’ve never individually designed, built, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`and`}</em>{` launched anything from start to finish aside from the site you’re reading right now. Fortunately, I was guided by services like `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://stackexchange.com\"\n      }}>{`Stack Exchange`}</a>{`, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://railscasts.com\"\n      }}>{`Railscasts`}</a>{`, and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://codeschool.com\"\n      }}>{`Code School`}</a>{` to steer me through the unfamiliar territory of building a web app. In the beginning, I knew very little about the inner workings of a site like Tab Lab, let alone how to architect an application around them. By the end, a holistic operational view of these components allowed me to design them from a more enlightened point of view.`}</p>\n    <figure {...{\n      \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figure\",\n      \"style\": {}\n    }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"800px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/b7d581ab803a2a005d2d32d37cb6da41/4b190/music-small.jpg\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"56.333333333333336%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"tablab.io music on small screens\",\n            \"title\": \"tablab.io music on small screens\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/b7d581ab803a2a005d2d32d37cb6da41/4b190/music-small.jpg\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/b7d581ab803a2a005d2d32d37cb6da41/f93b5/music-small.jpg 300w\", \"/static/b7d581ab803a2a005d2d32d37cb6da41/b4294/music-small.jpg 600w\", \"/static/b7d581ab803a2a005d2d32d37cb6da41/4b190/music-small.jpg 800w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span>{`\n    `}<figcaption parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"\n      }}>{`tablab.io music on small screens`}</figcaption>{`\n  `}</figure>\n    <p>{`Consistent with my personality, I shared very little about this project until close to launch day.
