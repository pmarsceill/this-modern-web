With the release of SwiftUI though, Apple has attempted to replicate a web developer\\u2019s ease-of-entry with a live preview mechanism and an abstracted language for constructing interfaces. This was enough to pique my interest and over the last month, I began playing with SwiftUI through \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://designcode.io/swiftui-course\"\n  }, \"Design+Code\\u2019s SwiftUI\"), \" course. Here are my initial impressions\\u2026\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Tooling\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Let me start out by saying that Xcode is an \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\"\n  }, \"IDE (integrated development environment)\"), \" and most modern web development tools are not. VSCode comes close-\", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"er\"), \", but it\\u2019s really not the same thing. Xcode has an editor, documentation, compiler, virtualization, and a rendering engine all-in-one \\u2014 including all the settings to boot. It feels big in every conceivable way to someone who isn\\u2019t used to working with a tool of this scope. In this new version of Xcode (version 11.3.1), Apple has added a new component called \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Canvas\"), \" that works exclusively with SwiftUI. Canvas is the real-time preview (+ inspector) that makes writing SwiftUI so compelling. With Swift \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"classic\"), \" (and ObjectiveC) apps, every time code was edited, a manual build step was required before you could preview the app in a separate process.

Who knows, maybe I\\u2019ll get something in the App Store this year?\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","rawMDXOutput":"/* @jsx mdx */\nimport { mdx } from '@mdx-js/react';\n/* @jsxRuntime classic */\n/* @jsx mdx */\nimport BigImage from \"../../src/components/big-img\"\nimport ImageRow from \"../../src/components/img-row\"\nexport const _frontmatter = {\n  \"title\": \"This web designer gets his wings\",\n  \"description\": \"My first impressions of SwiftUI\",\n  \"date\": \"2020-03-13T02:59:33-0500\",\n  \"tags\": [\"journal\", \"SwiftUI\", \"Learning\"],\n  \"featuredImage\": \"./assets/swift-for-web-designers/swift_logo.png\"\n};\n\nconst layoutProps = {\n  _frontmatter\n};\nconst MDXLayout = \"wrapper\"\nexport default function MDXContent({\n  components,\n  ...props\n}) {\n  return <MDXLayout {...layoutProps} {...props} components={components} mdxType=\"MDXLayout\">\n\n    <p>{`In recent years, designing and building for the web has taken a few steps closer toward application development (for better or worse) with the advent of modern frameworks like React. These encourage a more app-centric approach to UI development through components and different ways of encapsulating logic and presentation layers. In the end though, the web still is — and probably always will be: markup, styles, and JavaScript served over a network to a browser that turns it into a UI. This protocol allows web developers to be productive very early-on in their journey because what you “write” is what you “get” and unlike compiled languages like Swift, there is no required build step before you can see the fruits of your labor. With the release of SwiftUI though, Apple has attempted to replicate a web developer’s ease-of-entry with a live preview mechanism and an abstracted language for constructing interfaces. This was enough to pique my interest and over the last month, I began playing with SwiftUI through `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://designcode.io/swiftui-course\"\n      }}>{`Design+Code’s SwiftUI`}</a>{` course. Here are my initial impressions…`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Tooling`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Let me start out by saying that Xcode is an `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\"\n      }}>{`IDE (integrated development environment)`}</a>{` and most modern web development tools are not. VSCode comes close-`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`er`}</em>{`, but it’s really not the same thing. Xcode has an editor, documentation, compiler, virtualization, and a rendering engine all-in-one — including all the settings to boot. It feels big in every conceivable way to someone who isn’t used to working with a tool of this scope. In this new version of Xcode (version 11.3.1), Apple has added a new component called `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Canvas`}</em>{` that works exclusively with SwiftUI. Canvas is the real-time preview (+ inspector) that makes writing SwiftUI so compelling. With Swift `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`classic`}</em>{` (and ObjectiveC) apps, every time code was edited, a manual build step was required before you could preview the app in a separate process. With SwiftUI + Canvas, the preview updates as-you-type(-ish) which is familiar to those of us using live-reload in our web browsers while developing web pages.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The Apple team has done a lot of things right in `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`not`}</em>{` making this version of Xcode overly complex to use, but coming from the light-weight world of Vim, VSCode, Atom, and Sublime Text, I do feel like sometimes I’m driving a tank — and a very delicate one at that. Often times while writing code, response time feels sluggish and triggers syntax error statements that may or may not be accurate. I find myself deleting and writing the same line multiple times to try to get a “true” result from the change. SwiftUI `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`is`}</em>{` in beta still, so I’ll chalk this up to it not being production-ready yet.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite some of the bulkiness and current fragility, I do really appreciate having the niceties of a full IDE at my fingertips. Take the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Library`}</em>{`, as an example: it’s a universal command palette that you can pull up while you’re writing code to search for specific parts of the Swift/SwiftUI API to use inline. I love that it has the docs `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`right there`}</em>{` and selecting an item inserts it right where I want it with placeholders for all the properties.`}</p>\n    <figure {...{\n      \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figure\",\n      \"style\": {}\n    }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"1200px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/cfcd909de9fc4de057f9606e442817c0/8b640/library.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"74.66666666666667%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"Library view in Xcode 11.3.1\",\n            \"title\": \"Library view in Xcode 11.3.1\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/cfcd909de9fc4de057f9606e442817c0/c1b63/library.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/cfcd909de9fc4de057f9606e442817c0/5a46d/library.png 300w\", \"/static/cfcd909de9fc4de057f9606e442817c0/0a47e/library.png 600w\", \"/static/cfcd909de9fc4de057f9606e442817c0/c1b63/library.png 1200w\", \"/static/cfcd909de9fc4de057f9606e442817c0/8b640/library.png 1454w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span>{`\n    `}<figcaption parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"\n      }}>{`Library view in Xcode 11.3.1`}</figcaption>{`\n  `}</figure>\n    <p>{`Another thing that I appreciate is the approach in integrating Canvas into Xcode and how it is very reminiscent of the early versions of Framer Studio.
