Within my first quarter, I joined a newly formed team that completely redesigned and rebuilt the top of the funnel of our flagship products. I loved putting stuff out into the world and seeing the internet light up praising or trashing it. Work then was ergonomic in a way that I had never experienced.

It turns out, that takes years (just like learning how to be a designer). In the last few years, I\\u2019ve found it in building my team and empowering them to be impactful with what they produce. This takes many forms; helping the team shape products, being a good listener, working on longer-term vision with my Product counter parts, helping my team identify areas for personal career growth.

Spending so much time on the road a musician, I had the privilege to see almost every major city in the US, and this is something that I think more people should experience. If only it was as easy as hoping on a train… that was fast… and had good food and decent wine.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Roughly a month before we got engaged in 2012 (about a year and a half before our wedding), I started working at Happy Cog studios in Philadelphia. Having spent the previous five years cutting my teeth at a fast-growing but way more corporate agency in the suburbs (a forty-five minute commute on a good day), this was an exciting change. This opportunity seemed to align much more with how I wanted to work: smaller and more meaningful projects where quality was regarded as important as revenue. Perhaps most valuable though, was the team I got to work with — super talented, opinionated, and genuinely fun people to spend eight hours a day with. At Happy Cog I made some of the best professional relationships of my career (which would eventually lead me to GitHub), learned a ton about design, web development, and was plugged in to a network of folks who literally made the internet that loved. Relationships aside, I also learned a lot about success and failure at Happy Cog, what I liked and disliked about design (and the industry in general), and what ultimately made me dread coming into work.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A year and a half into my tenure, there were signs that the company itself was beginning to struggle; people were fired, there were layoffs, eventually our Austin office closed without much notice. I stuck through it in hopes that things would get better, but ultimately I just felt burnt out. By the end of the my third year I stopped feeling a connection to the work. I struggled to feel purpose investing my time in solving problems for clients when I knew the solutions would ultimately be at the fate of whatever level of corporate dysfunction they possessed.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I like to imagine that this is when I went through my career adolescence and discovered who I was and what I valued in my work. When I made the decision to leave Happy Cog, I knew that the years I spent doing client/agency work served me well, but there wasn’t much drive left there. Ultimately, I craved the opportunity to work on problems that I felt true ownership over, shared a sense of investment, and had some iterative process in solving. Around the same time, I also gained a deeper fascination with developer tools and the communities around them. To scratch my own itch, I designed and built my the first end-to-end side project, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/2015/02/06/tab-lab/\"\n      }}>{`Tab Lab`}</a>{`. This little taste of working on a product that I felt passionate about got me hooked, so when I had the chance to interview at GitHub in the summer of 2015, I jumped at it.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`My daughter was born in May of 2015 and everything changed. Not only did I want to spend more time at home, I gained the benefit of leaving the pretty strict nine-to-five-ish work schedule in favor of a flexible remote one. This was a huge factor in my choosing to work at GitHub. Being around for all the moments in the early years of my daughter’s life alone outweighed any uncertainties I had about the decision. Working remotely isn’t for everyone though, and I did struggle with some aspects initially. I no longer had to commute so most of my day was spent in a chair at my desk. Finding ways to get out of the house became a must — for me this meant going to the gym regularly and getting my body moving. I seriously took up running and haven’t regretted a second of it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The next few years seemed to happen at warp speed. Time gets really distorted after you have kids. I imagine that the lack of sleep, the series of temporary routines that constantly get disrupted, and the speed at which kids’ brains and bodies develop, swirl around and affect how our minds perceive time passing. Having settled into parental life, our daughter grew from an infant to toddler to a kid  and started going to pre-school in our neighborhood. She gained her own life, best friends, interests, tastes, and opinions. In all of this (and I know it’s cliché to say this) being a parent dwarfs all other aspects in my life in almost every way that I can think of, especially once the develop a true sense of self.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Early on at GitHub, I found an incredibly empowering and energizing sense of autonomy. I was pushing code to production (GitHub.com) in my first month as a designer and I had never felt a sense of sheer power like that before. It really did feel like a drug. Within my first quarter, I joined a newly formed team that completely redesigned and rebuilt the top of the funnel of our flagship products. I loved putting stuff out into the world and seeing the internet light up praising or trashing it. Work then was ergonomic in a way that I had never experienced. GitHub used the best workflow that I had seen to implement and deploy products. The spikes of dopamine that you get from making stuff at that scale is hard to beat and I could see how it becomes addictive.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I decided to pursue management during my second year at GitHub. It was a big adjustment and a different sense of reward, one that I’m still figuring out. Instead of getting the high from designing, building, and shipping products, I had to find what would become my hook into management. It turns out, that takes years (just like learning how to be a designer). In the last few years, I’ve found it in building my team and empowering them to be impactful with what they produce. This takes many forms; helping the team shape products, being a good listener, working on longer-term vision with my Product counter parts, helping my team identify areas for personal career growth. Still though, nothing beats the feeling of waking up on a ship day.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
