One great example of this is the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://workingcopyapp.com/\"\n      }}>{`Working Copy`}</a>{` app. Working Copy is a Git client for iOS and iPadOS, which in itself is handy for editing and pushing code from your iPhone or iPad. Outside of being a nice Git client, the team has also built a deep integration with SiriKit, opening up entirely new workflows not even found on MacOS. Using Shortcuts, we can now access many individual tasks within specific apps (such as basic Git commands from within Working Copy) as pieces of larger workflows that pass data between other Siri-enabled apps.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`What are Siri Shortcuts anyway?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Before getting into examples of how to set up your device with handy dev-centric Shortcuts, let’s review exactly what they are and some of the core concepts around them.`}</p>\n    <SmallImage mdxType=\"SmallImage\">\n      <figure {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figure\",\n        \"style\": {}\n      }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"position\": \"relative\",\n            \"display\": \"block\",\n            \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n            \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n            \"maxWidth\": \"600px\"\n          }\n        }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n            \"href\": \"/static/c27e258d08d60e7a46862ae5c73da602/0a47e/shortcuts-app.png\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            },\n            \"target\": \"_blank\",\n            \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n          }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n              \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n              \"style\": {\n                \"paddingBottom\": \"216.66666666666666%\",\n                \"position\": \"relative\",\n                \"bottom\": \"0\",\n                \"left\": \"0\",\n                \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n                \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n                \"display\": \"block\"\n              }\n            }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n              \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n              \"alt\": \"Shortcuts app, \\\"Edit\\\" view on iOS 13\",\n              \"title\": \"Shortcuts app, \\\"Edit\\\" view on iOS 13\",\n              \"src\": \"/static/c27e258d08d60e7a46862ae5c73da602/0a47e/shortcuts-app.png\",\n              \"srcSet\": [\"/static/c27e258d08d60e7a46862ae5c73da602/5a46d/shortcuts-app.png 300w\", \"/static/c27e258d08d60e7a46862ae5c73da602/0a47e/shortcuts-app.png 600w\"],\n              \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\",\n              \"style\": {\n                \"width\": \"100%\",\n                \"height\": \"100%\",\n                \"margin\": \"0\",\n                \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n                \"position\": \"absolute\",\n                \"top\": \"0\",\n                \"left\": \"0\"\n              },\n              \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n              \"decoding\": \"async\"\n            }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span>{`\n    `}<figcaption parentName=\"figure\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"\n        }}>{`Shortcuts app, \"Edit\" view on iOS 13`}</figcaption>{`\n  `}</figure>\n    </SmallImage>\n    <p>{`iOS 13 brought a new Shortcuts app to our devices. This app is the engine that allows us to create specific workflows using individual tasks, called actions, from many individual apps and connect them together into one string of events called a shortcut. These shortcuts are accessible from OS-level context menus (primarily the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`share sheet`}</em>{`), kicked off manually from the home screen, or automatically run at a certain time interval.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While Shortcuts can be used to accomplish any number of tasks (like getting walking directions to the nearest coffee shop), they are especially valuable to me in transforming my iOS devices into automated development tools. Let’s dig in to some common use-cases.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Running a simple curl command`}</h2>\n    <p>{`My initial motivation was fairly niche; I wanted to build a shortcut that used the camera on my iPhone to take a photo of an album cover, identify what it was, and then add that album to a Spotify playlist. It’s handy when shopping for vinyl or cataloging my existing record collection and creating a digital version on Spotify.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I found that the simplest way to identify the contents of a photo was to use Google Vision. Specifically, the image annotation API. After researching several ways to hit this API from my phone, I stumbled upon the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Get contents of `}<code parentName=\"em\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"language-text\"\n        }}>{`<url>`}</code></em>{` action could be used to send curl commands. This made hitting the Google Vision API with an encoded version of the photo that I just took feel too easy. This specific action is built into Shortcuts itself (not tied to any particular app) and has many uses. It can hit API endpoints, grab an RSS feed, download and parse the contents of a webpage, or grab any data that is backed by a URL. As I learned, it is also very handy for making a single curl command and getting a response back. A more complicated API integration may be better served using another app with Shortcuts support (like Scriptable, more on this later) to handle more advanced back-and-forth and parsing of an API response.`}</p>\n    <SmallImage mdxType=\"SmallImage\">\n      <figure {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-figure\",\n        \"style\": {}\n      }}>{`\n    `}<span
